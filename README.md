> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted a simple, conveneient way to not only rate what you read, but see what other people think about the same book? Introducing Koob, a website where you can upload any and all books, comics, poetry, and more, all to be rated and even commented on by the user. Unlike other rating sites, this gives complete freedom for uploads, allowing for all literature to be included, as well as a personal ranking system, where you can compile a list of all of your favorite media and how they rank amongst others of their type.

### Design

![Design image](placeholder.png)

This would be the design flow of the website:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    actor Website
    actor List
    actor Profile
    actor DB
    actor Search


    User->>Website: Login
    Website-->>User: Fail to login
    User-->>DB: Stores login info
    Website->>List: User creates entry
    List->>Profile: List is updated on profile
    Profile->>DB: Profile is stored
    Profile-->>List: Set list to public
    List-->>Website: Visible to all
    User->>Search: User searches a user ID
    Search-->>Profile: After searching, user will be taken to profile

    
```

### Key features
- Able to create an entry for any piece of media and rate it
- Images associated with each entry
- Able to create a list of any one type of media and rank each entry in the list
- Able to add a numerical rating to each entry, as well as a comment

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - The structure of the weebsite will be as follows: Across the very top will be the title of the website. A little below that will be a header, telling which section of the website someone is in (i.e., Upload, List, etc.). Then, a small paragraph outlining what goes on in each link (i.e., the upload section would have something like "Choose a title for your work, as well as a picture, and then give it a ranking and/or a comment!"). HTML will be used to display whatever image the user uploads as part of the entry. Finally, on a bar across the top will be the links created by HTML to take the user to the different sections of the site. Thesse will include "Entry/upload" to make a new entry, "Lists" to show all the lists a user has created and be able to edit them, and "Profile" to show the users site information, as well as their lists publicly (unless specified otherwise). There will be a search bar to find specific users and their profiles.

- **CSS** - I will use Lucida Console fixed font throughout the website. I will use a dark forest green, white, and a gold-ish yellow. The buttons will be rectangular, with rounded corners. There will be partitions between each of the links, as well as the header and title. This will also allow for me to change the color of the font for the rating itself (which will be 1-10), with each rating being a different color, progressing from red (at 1) up to green (at 10).

- **React** - I will use react for a react router, which will let me have the multiple pages that I would need for each of the links. I will have a tally that will update with each new entry, showing how many a user has for each list. In the lists section, there will be an option to edit or delete an entry. There will also be a way to login. Lists can also be set to public or private.

- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - Login
    - Submitting entry
    - Receiving entry
    - Updating lists publically and privately

- **DB/Login** - This will store the users, entries, and lists. It will allow users to register and login. Credentials will be securely stored in the database. Entries cannot be created unless the user is logged in. Lists associated with users will also be stored in the database.

- **WebSocket** - As the users create entries, they will be public on their profiles for others to view via searching the profile.
